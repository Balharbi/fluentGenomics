abstract: "We construct a simple workflow for fluent genomics data analysis using the R/Biocondcutor ecosystem. This involves three core steps: **import** the data into an appropriate abstraction, **model** the data with respect to the biological questions of interest, and **transform** the results with respect to their underlying genomic coordinates. Here we show how to implement these steps to integrate published RNA-seq and ATAC-seq experiments on macrophage cell lines. Using *tximeta*, we **import** RNA-seq transcript quantifications into an analysis-ready data structure, called the *SummarizedExperiment*, that contains the ranges of the reference transcripts and metadata on their provenance. Using *SummarizedExperiment*s to represent the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, we **model**  differentially accessible (DA) chromatin peaks and differentially expressed (DE) genes with existing Bioconductor packages. Using *plyranges* we then **transform** the results to see if there is an enrichment of DE genes nearby DA peaks by finding overlaps and aggregating over log-fold change thresholds. The combination of these packages and their integration with the Bioconductor ecosystem provides a coherent framework for analysts to iteratively and reproducibly explore their biological data."
